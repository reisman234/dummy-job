# Dummy-Job

This repository contains sources and artifacts for a dummy-job container for the [workflow-api](https://github.com/reisman234/workflow-api). The container is the base for two different jobs, a job without any input which is defined by the [workflow-asset dummy](./resouces/dummy.json) and a job with multiple different input files, which is defined in the [workflow-asset input-dummy](./resouces/input-dummy.json).
